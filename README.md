## Features

- **Requirements Management**: Create and manage software requirements with validation and lifecycle tracking
- **Task Management**: Track implementation tasks with hierarchical structure and effort estimation
- **Architecture Decisions**: Record ADRs (Architecture Decision Records) with full context
- **GitHub Integration**: Automatic GitHub issue creation and bidirectional synchronization
- **Project Dashboards**: Real-time project health metrics and status reporting
- **Requirement Tracing**: Complete traceability from requirements through implementation
- **State Validation**: Automatic validation of lifecycle state transitions
- **Relationship Tracking**: Many-to-many relationships between requirements, tasks, and architecture

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/heffrey78/lifecycle-mcp.git
cd lifecycle-mcp

# 2. Install globally (easiest for using across projects)
pip install -e .

# 3. Go to any project where you want to use lifecycle management
cd /path/to/your/project

# 4. Optional: Configure GitHub integration
./setup-github.sh  # Interactive setup, or set environment variables manually

# 5. Add the MCP server to Claude
claude mcp add lifecycle lifecycle-mcp -e LIFECYCLE_DB=/path/to/your/project/lifecycle.db

# 6. Start using lifecycle tools in Claude!
```

## Installation Options

### Prerequisites (Optional)
If you want to use `uv` (faster Python package manager):
```bash
# macOS/Linux
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

# Or with homebrew
brew install uv
```

### Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/heffrey78/lifecycle-mcp.git
cd lifecycle-mcp
```

## Usage with Claude Code

For detailed examples and scenarios, see [USAGE_EXAMPLES.md](USAGE_EXAMPLES.md).

### Option 1: Global Installation (Recommended for Multiple Projects)

Install the server globally so it can be used from any project:

```bash
# From the lifecycle-mcp directory
pip install -e .

# Now from ANY project directory, add the server:
claude mcp add lifecycle lifecycle-mcp -e LIFECYCLE_DB=./lifecycle.db
```

**Note**: Each project gets its own database file in its directory.

### Option 2: Run from Source with uv

If you prefer not to install globally:

```bash
# Get the full path to the lifecycle-mcp directory
LIFECYCLE_PATH="/path/to/lifecycle-mcp"  # Replace with your actual path

# From any project directory:
claude mcp add lifecycle $(which uv) -- --directory $LIFECYCLE_PATH run server.py -e LIFECYCLE_DB=./lifecycle.db
```

### Option 3: Direct Python Execution

For maximum compatibility:

```bash
# Get the full path to the server
LIFECYCLE_PATH="/path/to/lifecycle-mcp"  # Replace with your actual path

# From any project directory:
claude mcp add lifecycle $(which python) $LIFECYCLE_PATH/server.py -e LIFECYCLE_DB=./lifecycle.db
```

## Manual Configuration

You can also manually edit your Claude Desktop configuration file:

**macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`  
**Windows**: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "lifecycle": {
      "command": "lifecycle-mcp",
      "env": {
        "LIFECYCLE_DB": "./lifecycle.db"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Best Practices

### Database Location
- Each project should have its own `lifecycle.db` file
- Use `LIFECYCLE_DB=./lifecycle.db` to create the database in the current project
- Or use an absolute path for a shared database: `LIFECYCLE_DB=/path/to/shared/lifecycle.db`

### Virtual Environment (Recommended)
```bash
# Create a virtual environment for lifecycle-mcp
cd /path/to/lifecycle-mcp
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install in the virtual environment
pip install -e .

# Find the venv's lifecycle-mcp command
which lifecycle-mcp  # Copy this path

# Use the full path when adding to Claude
claude mcp add lifecycle /path/to/venv/bin/lifecycle-mcp -e LIFECYCLE_DB=./lifecycle.db
```

- **Events**: Automatic logging of lifecycle events and status changes
- **Reviews**: Comments and feedback on requirements and tasks

## Entity ID Formats

- **Requirements**: `REQ-XXXX-TYPE-VV` (e.g., REQ-0001-FUNC-00)
- **Tasks**: `TASK-XXXX-YY-ZZ` (e.g., TASK-0001-00-00)
- **Architecture**: `ADR-XXXX` (e.g., ADR-0001)

## GitHub Integration

This server includes optional GitHub integration that automatically creates GitHub issues for tasks and keeps them synchronized.

### Quick Setup

```bash
# Option 1: Interactive setup (recommended)
./setup-github.sh

# Option 2: Manual setup
export GITHUB_INTEGRATION_ENABLED=true
export GITHUB_TOKEN=$(gh auth token)  # Requires GitHub CLI
export GITHUB_REPO="your-username/your-repository"
```

### Configuration Options

- **`GITHUB_INTEGRATION_ENABLED`**: Enable/disable GitHub integration (default: `false`)
- **`GITHUB_TOKEN`**: GitHub personal access token (required when enabled)
- **`GITHUB_REPO`**: Repository in `owner/name` format (required when enabled)
- **`GITHUB_PROJECT_ID`**: GitHub project board ID (optional)
- **`GITHUB_PROJECT_TYPE`**: Project type `v1` or `v2` (default: `v2`)

### Features

- ✅ **Automatic Issue Creation**: Tasks automatically create GitHub issues
- ✅ **Bidirectional Sync**: Changes in GitHub sync back to lifecycle tasks
- ✅ **Status Mapping**: Task statuses map to GitHub issue states and project columns
- ✅ **Conflict Detection**: Identifies sync conflicts for manual resolution
- ✅ **Safe by Default**: GitHub integration disabled unless explicitly configured

### Verification

Test your GitHub configuration:

```bash
uv run python3 -c "
from src.lifecycle_mcp.github_utils import GitHubUtils
import asyncio
health = asyncio.run(GitHubUtils.check_github_health())
print('✅ Ready!' if not health['error_messages'] else 'Issues:', health['error_messages'])
"
```

📖 **[Complete GitHub Configuration Guide](CONFIGURATION.md)** - Detailed setup instructions, deployment scenarios, and troubleshooting.

### GitHub Relationship Sync Utility

For existing tasks with GitHub issues, you can sync parent-child relationships to create GitHub sub-issue links:

```bash
# Quick sync with automatic environment setup
./sync-github-relationships.sh

# Or run the Python script directly
python sync_github_relationships.py

# Preview what would be synced (dry run)
./sync-github-relationships.sh --dry-run

# Enable verbose logging
./sync-github-relationships.sh --verbose
```

**What it does:**
- Finds all tasks that have both a `parent_task_id` and a `github_issue_number`
- Identifies parent tasks that also have GitHub issues
- Creates GitHub sub-issue relationships using the GitHub GraphQL API
- Provides detailed reporting of successes and failures

**Prerequisites:**
- GitHub CLI (`gh`) installed and authenticated
- Repository must be a GitHub repository
- GitHub integration must be enabled (script will attempt to auto-configure)
- Tasks must already have GitHub issues created

**Example output:**
```
Found 33 tasks with GitHub issue numbers
Found 4 parent-child relationships to sync
Sync completed: 4 successful, 0 failed

✅ Successfully linked 4 parent-child relationships!
```

## Environment Variables

- `LIFECYCLE_DB`: Path to SQLite database file (default: "./lifecycle.db")
- `LIFECYCLE_CONFIG_FILE`: Path to JSON configuration file (default: "./lifecycle-config.json")
- `GITHUB_INTEGRATION_ENABLED`: Enable GitHub integration (default: `false`)
- `GITHUB_TOKEN`: GitHub personal access token (required when GitHub enabled)
- `GITHUB_REPO`: GitHub repository in owner/name format (required when GitHub enabled)
- `GITHUB_PROJECT_ID`: GitHub project board ID (optional)
- `GITHUB_PROJECT_TYPE`: GitHub project type - `v1` or `v2` (default: `v2`)

## Troubleshooting

### Connection Issues

**"MCP error -32000: Connection closed"**

This error typically occurs when there are async/await mismatches in the server implementation. If you encounter this:

1. Ensure the package is properly installed:
   ```bash
   pip install -e .
   ```

2. Re-add the MCP server:
  a. Default, either with environment variables set or GitHub integration disabled:
   ```bash
   claude mcp add lifecycle lifecycle-mcp
   ```

  b. Using an .env file to set variables in support of GitHub integration:
   ```bash
   source .env && claude mcp add lifecycle lifecycle-mcp
   ```

3. Check that the server starts without errors:
   ```bash
   lifecycle-mcp
   ```

**Server Not Found**

If the `lifecycle-mcp` command is not found after installation:

1. Verify installation completed successfully
2. Check that the entry point is registered in `pyproject.toml`
3. Try reinstalling with `pip install -e .`

### Database Issues

**Database Lock Errors**

If you see database lock errors, ensure only one instance of the server is running and that the database file has proper permissions.

**Schema Initialization**

The database schema is automatically created on first run. If you need to reset the database, simply delete the SQLite file (default: `lifecycle.db`).

## Development

### Using uv (Recommended)
```bash
# Install dependencies
uv sync

# Run the server directly
uv run server.py

# Test with Claude Code
claude mcp add lifecycle $(which uv) -- --directory $(pwd) run server.py
```

### Using pip (Traditional)
```bash
# Install in development mode
pip install -e .

# Run the server
lifecycle-mcp

# Test with Claude Code
claude mcp add lifecycle lifecycle-mcp
```

## Building Desktop Extension (.dxt)

To create a Desktop Extension package for one-click installation:

```bash
# Build the .dxt file
make build-dxt
# or
python build_dxt.py
```

This creates `lifecycle-mcp-1.0.0.dxt` which users can double-click to install in Claude Desktop.
